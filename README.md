# üõ†Ô∏è Slimefun Items Exporter

This is a simple tool to export all the items in [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) into a simple JSON file.
This can be used to create informational websites, bots or just to calculate things like crafting cost.

If you do not wish to manually run and automate keeping the file up to date yourself I also have it hosted myself: https://static.walshy.dev/items.json
